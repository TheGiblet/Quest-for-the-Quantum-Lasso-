Luka Bloodstone  

**Occupation:** Galactic Outlaw, Space Cowboy

**Luka Bloodstone** born under the twin moons of **Nexar Prime**, a desolate rock orbiting a dying star. His parents, both renegades with a penchant for trouble, taught him the ways of the cosmos aboard their rusted starship, the **Nova Vagabond**. They navigated asteroid fields, smuggled forbidden artifacts, and danced with cosmic anomalies.

Luka became a cosmic outlaw, evading Syndicate cruisers, bounty hunters, and black-market informants. His crew consisted of misfits and dreamers.

Together, they charted a course through wormholes, asteroid belts, and forgotten nebulae. External forces led them to the **Singularity Casino**, where black holes gambled with fate, and the **Quasar Sirens**, ethereal beings who sang forgotten prophecies, Luka Bloodstone it is your destiny to find the Quantum Lasso, defeat Niko and her ruthless Syndicate and save time its self. No pressure.
