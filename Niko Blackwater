Niko Blackwater, Harbinger of Shadows

**Name:** Niko Blackwater

 **Occupation:** Rogue Assassin, Cursed Seeker

Niko Blackwater was born in the forsaken city of **Umbralhaven**, where the sun rarely pierced the perpetual twilight. there parents were practitioners of forbidden arts—necromancers who whispered to the dead and bargained with malevolent spirits. They bound Niko’s fate with a blood pact to usher in a new era of suffering, etching sigils into her flesh granted her unnatural abilities.

As a child, Niko witnessed their rituals—their eyes aflame with forbidden knowledge. They taught her to wield shadows like blades, to slip through reality’s cracks, and to silence enemies with a single touch. But every gift came with a price.

whispers of an ancient prophecy—the **Eclipse Prophecy**—foretelling the rise of a shadow-walker who would tip the cosmic balance. Niko’s blood pact seemed woven into this prophecy, and Lady Seraphine watched her with eyes like twin moons.
